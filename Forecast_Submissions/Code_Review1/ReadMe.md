1.) Hello and welcome! Good luck with this code and thank you for reviewing it for me.

2.) This code was written to run with 6 days of last week's forecast flow data. I will be checking starting early Saturday morning 10/09/21 to download the streamflow data so that you can get started as soon as you want to. I will download the data no later than 10:00 am.

3.) Please insert values generated by the code starting from here on.

Average flow for the past 6 days of the forecast period:

(please replace zero with the output from the code)

flow = 0 cfs


Summary statistics for all October flows 1989-2021: (please replace each zero with the value generated by the code)

    count  0
    mean   0
    std    0
    min    0
    25%    0
    50%    0
    75%    0
    max    0

4.) Please insert plots generated by the code.

Observed Flow for Week 10/03/21-10/08/21:

This plot has been saved automatically as "Wk6_Obs.png" in the file titled "images" within "Forecast_Submissions." Utilize the VSCode plugin we installed to copy the plot from its file into this markdown.






1 Week Forecast Window 5 Year History Plot:

I could not figure out how to properly save this plot individually as it is set up in a function, so you will have to save it from within VSCODE. Please save it within the file titled "images" within "Forecast_Submissions." See the following path: HAS_Tools_Repo_Dump\homework\Forecast_Submissions\images.
Please name this file '1Wk_Past.png'. Then utilize the VSCode plugin we installed to copy the plot from its file into this markdown. p.s. I'm sorry for the hassle.






2 Week Forecast Window 5 Year History Plot:

Same issue as previous plot. I could not figure out how to properly save this plot individually as it is set up in a function, so you will have to save it from within VSCODE. Please save it within the file titled "images" within "Forecast_Submissions." See the following path: HAS_Tools_Repo_Dump\homework\Forecast_Submissions\images.
Please name this file '2Wk_Past.png'. Then utilize the VSCode plugin we installed to copy the plot from its file into this markdown. p.s. I'm sorry for the hassle, again.





October Flow Histogram:

This plot has been saved automatically as "Oct_Hist.png" in the file titled "images" within "Forecast_Submissions." Utilize the VSCode plugin we installed to copy the plot from its file into this markdown.





4.) Enter forecast submissions generated by the code.

Code Review Rubric: (feel free to delete the rubric after completing your
  review. I leave it up to you on how you prefer to write it!)

Use the following questions to guide your review. At a minimum you should provide (1) a written assessment and (2) a numeric score to each of the three questions listed below. Refer to the rubric for a guide to scoring.

Wherever possible include line numbers and specific pointers. Remember the goal is not just to point out areas that could be improved but to provide your partner ideas for how to do better. For example you might suggest:
- Clever ways to use built-in functionality (when appropriate)
- Simpler ways to implement the same functionality
- General improvements to structure, style, and naming

And of course remember to always be courteous to the person you are reviewing!

### Questions to consider
1. Is the script easy to read and understand?
 - Are variables and functions named descriptively when useful?
 - Are the comments helpful?
 - Can you run the script on your own easily?
 - Are the doc-strings useful?

2. Does the code follow PEP8 style consistently?
 - If not are there specific instances where the script diverges from this style?

3. Is the code written succinctly and efficiently?
 - Are there superfluous code sections?
 - Is the use of functions appropriate?
 - Is the code written elegantly without decreasing readability?
