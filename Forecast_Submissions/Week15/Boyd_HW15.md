3/3: Great job I'm glad you got it working!  Also a good question on interactive nodes. We'll talk more about this tomorrow. 

**1.) What resources did you request on Puma? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?**

As far as I know, my script did not need any resources other than one node to run the script. I only had to wait about 7 minutes all in all for the script to complete its run.

**2.) What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Puma?**

Making sure I was running each step in the correct location within the terminal. It was difficult for me to keep track of the variety of pieces needed for the initial set up of the HPC access. However, I found the HPC easy to use once that set up was finished.

**3.) What questions do you still have after doing this?**

I don't understand the difference between the "interactive" and the shell we are already in when we open it, or why we cannot run .sh files from the interactive.
