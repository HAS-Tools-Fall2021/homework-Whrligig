I decided to set my estimate for the week of 09/05-09/11 as 162 cfs.
The average daily flow for the preceeding week was lower than I expected so I
adjusted my guess for this week to reflect a lower number. I also estimated
that next week the flow will be about 137 cfs, since it seems as though the rain
has been dropping off and this value is closer to the average flow value for this
time of year.
