Connal Boyd 08/29/21 Forecast 1

I chose 236 cfs as my Week 1 discharge forecast since the average cfs values
for the past several weeks in August 2021 have been in the 200 cfs range. Last
week saw much higher discharge, so I did not base my guess on that week alone.
The historical data showed the average daily discharge for August is about 172
cfs, so I decided to estimate a higher value since this has been a wetter year
for our area. I chose a lower number for the Week 2 discharge value, 188 cfs,
since the weather has been drying up some and this value is closer to the
average daily discharge value for August over the last 32 years.

## Grade
3/3 - great job!
